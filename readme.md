# assemblebot

> Bot to listen to and respond to issues open on assemble repositories.

## Usage

This project is intended to be run on [webtask.io](https://webtask.io/). Take the following steps to build and deploy the project.

### Install

Install node modules

```sh
$ npm install
```

If you have not already installed and signed up with webtask, [follow their instructions](https://webtask.io/cli) to install their [webtask cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wt-cli) globally and register.

```sh
$ npm i -g wt-cli
```

### Build

Build executes a `browserify` script from the `package.json` and prepends the contents with required code for webtask.io. The built script is found in `./dist/main.js`.

```sh
$ gulp build
```

### Deploy

Deploy executes a webtask `wt create` command to push the `./dist/main.js` file to a webtask container.
This task requires a secret `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be deployed with the webtask. The token can be generated using the [github personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page.

```
$ gulp deploy --secret GITHUB_TOKEN={SECRET_TOKEN}
```

### Github webhook

Finally, to activate the assemblebot, [create a github webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) on the repository or organization the bot should listen to.
